Program is compiled as:
  python fluxionalize.py -p [number of processsors, default 2] -n [name, default "test"] -l [location, default current working directory]
                         -c [number of clusters saved in [name]_out, default 1] -i [input]

  Input is given as -i '[SMILES string]' or -i [file], requiring quotation marks for the SMILES string input 
    to avoid bash syntax error

When the calculation has completed, the following files/directories will have been generated in the specified/default location:
    [name]_out     contains the conformer pdb files for each instance
    [name].out     the logfile from the queue containing all the runtime command line outputs
    [name].tar.gz  contains all the files used and generated by the work flow, compressed for space


All of the files in this repository besides fluxionalize.py and flux.py should be saved in a src_files directory. If another directory
 is used, then that location will have to be changed in flux.py.
 
Files to Edit:
    mol_cluster files         the catdcd location will have to be specified (line 3)
    

Files to Check:
    fluxionalize.py           check modules: intel64, openmpi. check version: namd
    flux.py                   check mpirun location, set to default
